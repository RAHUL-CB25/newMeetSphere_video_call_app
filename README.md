# MeetSphere 🎥💻  
A live **video calling web application** built with the **MERN stack**, **WebRTC**, and **Socket.IO**.  
MeetSphere enables smooth real-time peer-to-peer video/audio communication directly from the browser.  

## 🌐 Live App  
👉 [MeetSphere Live App](https://newmeetsphere-video-call-app-1-frontend.onrender.com/)

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔗 Real-time **peer-to-peer video/audio calls** using WebRTC  
- ⚡ **Socket.IO** for signaling and live communication  
- 👥 Create and join rooms for private video calls  
- 🔒 Secure and efficient **data transfer** without overloading the server  
- 🌐 Deployed as a live web app

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js (UI + WebRTC integration)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (APIs, signaling server)  
- **Database:** MongoDB (user/session management)  
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO  
- **Video/Audio Transfer:** WebRTC (P2P connection)  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Data Transfer)  
1. When two users join a room, **Socket.IO** handles signaling (exchange of connection details).  
2. Once signaling completes, **WebRTC** creates a **peer-to-peer connection**.  
3. Audio and video streams flow **directly between users**, reducing server load.  
4. The backend manages authentication, room creation, and relaying messages before the P2P connection is established.

## 📝 Note  
This app is **live** and fully functional.  
You can **download the code and use it directly**, but **do not make any changes** — everything is already set up and deployed successfully.
